# TwentyOne
A Simple Console Game of Blackjack

Author: Daniel Hong
Language: C# (.NET 6.0)
Description:
  This application is a simple demonstration of compartmentalization and modularity of modern OOPs using C#. The primary purpose of (beyond creating a game of black jack) is to be able to build off of this platform.
Further plans:
  Customizeable house rules through configuration management
  Replacing the UI class with a REST api and linking it to a Browser-based (Javascript/HTML/CSS) User Interface
